Contributions
=============

Pull requests are always welcome on `GitHub`_! That said, please be open to
discussing the PR content, and possibly revising it if requested. Not all
requests can be merged, and not all changes are desired.

Or, you can contribute some money, instead! Check out `my Patreon
<https://www.patreon.com/DanHunsaker>`_ for options, there. Other options will
likely be added for one-time donations in the future.

Security Reporting
------------------

Report all security-related issues to `dan (dot) hunsaker (plus) calends (at)
gmail <mailto:dan.hunsaker+calends@gmail.com>`_, and use PGP or GPG protections
on your message (the account's key is ``44806AB9``, or you can look it up by the
email address). Security issues will be addressed internally before making any
vulnerability announcements.
