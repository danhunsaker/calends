Installing Calends for Golang
=============================

Install the library with ``go get github.com/danhunsaker/calends``, and then
``import "github.com/danhunsaker/calends"`` wherever you intend to use it. If
you're using another Go dependency manager, you'll need to use its dependency
installation method instead; consult its documentation for more details, as we
can't possibly cover them all here.
