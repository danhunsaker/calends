Installing Calends for Dart
===========================

For use with Dart, use pub as normal:

.. code-block:: bash

   dart pub add calends

Or with Flutter:

.. code-block:: bash

   flutter pub add calends

You'll also need to grab the latest version of ``libcalends`` from the
`GitHub Releases page <https://github.com/danhunsaker/calends/releases>`_, and
extract its contents (you can skip any ``.h`` files) into your project's root
directory, next to ``pubspec.yaml``. Be sure to grab the correct archive for
your architecture!
